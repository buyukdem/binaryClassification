Content of the work

You can use built-in ML functions of Python or R programming platform you develop your code. 
You can also use any other built-in functions (for example cov, pdist, mean, eig, etc).  

IMPORTANT: The aim of this work is to predict the gender class and evaluate the algorithms which you used.

The dataset can be found at 'dataset.csv' file.

Use random half of the dataset for training and other half for test by preserving the distribution of the classes (gender) in the original dataset. 

1) Guess (randomly) genders for the test dataset using different probabilities, and plot accuracy and F1 scores.
(probability sets: {M:0.1, F:0.9}, {M:0.2, F:0.8}, ..., {M:0.9, F:0.1})
Hint (Part of an R code): sample(c("Male", "Female"), length(test_dataset), replace = TRUE, prob=c(p, 1-p)) ##!! nrow(test_dataset) !!

2) Use 2 different classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, etc)
Choose the model that gives the highest F1 score on the training set.
Predict genders for the test set data. Show the confusion matrix, and calculate the accuracy, F1 score, precision and recall.

3) Briefly write your comments about the obtained results.
